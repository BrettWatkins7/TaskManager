# Task Manager Projects

This repository contains two separate task manager projects implemented in C++:

---

## 1. TaskCLI

A simple **command-line task manager**.  
Features:
- Add, list, and remove tasks directly from the terminal.
- Minimal and lightweight, great for learning and practicing C++ basics.

---

## 2. TaskGUI

A more advanced **graphical task manager** built using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).  
Features:
- Modern, interactive GUI for managing tasks.
- Add and remove tasks with a single click.
- Optional checkbox to mark tasks as done.
- Dynamic input field and task list.
